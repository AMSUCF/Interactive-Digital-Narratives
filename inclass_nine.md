## In Class Making Nine: Polishing and GUI Design

For our final in-class working time on your Ren'Py games, bring your draft-in-progress. We will review:

- [Customizing your interface](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/gui.html) - this includes both changing fonts and images as well as more advanced styling options for shifting the dialogue and menu appearances.
- [Developer tool usage](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/developer_tools.html) - we will review the tools available for checking for errors and debugging your code, and there will be supported time for debugging your code.
- [Code structure and submission](github.md) - we will revisit the steps for working with GitHub pages, and review the process for packaging and publishing your final game for next Monday's showcase.

As this is primarily supported working time, there is no submission: make sure you sign in to receive credit for attendance.
