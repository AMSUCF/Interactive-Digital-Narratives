## Course Description

Contemporary forms of interactive digital narrative, ranging from electronic literature to games, demonstrate the affordances of the computer as a site of storytelling. Working from the prehistory of Oulipian constrained writing through to early hypertext experiments of authors such as Shelley Jackson to contemporary games such as Kentucky Route Zero, we will develop an understanding of both the history and current trends in born-digital literary experimentation and practice. Through the lens of these digital texts, we will explore the potential for reimagining the "book" through new interfaces, interactions, and technologies. No knowledge of code is necessary. 

The course is divided into two units, with corresponding creative projects: 

- **Hypertext & Electronic Literature.** In our first unit, we will read and critique printed nonlinear narratives, using both physical and digital works as an inspiration and considering the history of design approaches to hypertextual play in print. Throughout, we will work with both paper-based narrative design and use Twine as a prototyping tool to build new interactive digital narratives. 
- **Adventure Games & Visual Novels.** In our second unit, we will consider narrative games, with particular attention to adventure games, visual novels, and quest-driven narratives. We will use Ren'Py to build small narrative experiences, working with systems for developing simple visual environments and character interactions and conversations. Examples will include games across genres, including visual novels, walking simulators, and casual games.

Students will have two personally-designed short interactive digital narratives completed at the conclusion of the course.

## Evaluation and Grading

| Points  | Assignment Summary |
|---|---|
| 30 | **In-Class Making*** - Every week, we will work on collaborative and individual creative exercises to conceptualize, prototype, design, develop, and test games. In-class exercises cannot be made up, but one can be missed with no penalty. |
| 15 | **Twine Hypertext** - Building on the in-class exercises, students will develop their own complete interactive hypertext in Twine, incorporating complex interactivity and digital storytelling with at least two meaningful endings. |
| 15 | **Ren'Py Game** - Building on the in-class exercises, students will develop their own complete visual narrative game in Ren'Py, incorporating environments and characters to tell a story. | |
| 30 |  **Interactive Digital Narrative Critiques** - Students will write three short papers reflecting on works of interactive digital narrative, selected from the provided lists for each genre or approved by the instructor. |
| 10 |  **Final Reflection** - The final exam will consist of a take-home reflection putting forth a personal design philosophy, informed by course readings and games. |

Grades are calculated out of 100 following a standard letter scale. Digital projects and critiques will be accepted up to three days late with no penalty. Attended is expected, but only in-class exercises are formally graded: if you miss a class, a summary of what you missed will be posted along with slides and any other materials in the Moodle.
