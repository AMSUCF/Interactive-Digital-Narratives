## Finishing Your Twine

During this class session, we will have supported time to finish your Twine hypertext. We will review the final steps, including:

- *Final debuggging.* Use test mode to check for and debug any remaining variable or logic errors, and confirm that your endings can be reached successfully as intended.
- *Finalizing style.* Check all passages for readability, and confirm all macros and stylesheets are displaying as intended. 
- *Removing whitespace.* We'll use the [whitespace collapsing](https://twine2.neocities.org/#markup_collapsing-whitespace) features of Harlowe to remove any unwanted whitespace in sections where lengthy code is running.
- *File structure.* Check all references to external files (including linkes or embeds of Bitsy, which we will review in class) and make sure all the files are in your GitHub repository.
- *Deployment.* We'll review the proces for final [deployment and publishing to the web](github.md).

The demo, which includes the [Harlowe Audio Library](https://twinelab.net/harlowe-audio/#/) and an embedded Bitsy game, is available for [code reference](https://anastasiasalter.net/twine_demo/).
