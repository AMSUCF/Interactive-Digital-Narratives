# Final Reflection

Throughout this semester, we've explored ways of thinking and ways of making interactive digital narratives. You've likely tried tools and methods that you found frustrating or limiting, and hopefully you also found a few that were compatible with your imagination and sparked new ideas for the future. This final reflection is an opportunity to think about that future work: in a short (500 - 750 word) essay, contextualize the design philosophy you've developed this semester. Your reflection should be guided by the following questions, which ask you to think about what you've made and what you might make in the future:

- **What are interactive digital narratives? How has your understanding of them changed over the course of this class?** Cite at least **three examples** from the readings and/or from games, hypertexts, electronic literature, visual novels, etc. that were played or discussed throughout the course in explaining your definition.

- **What were you most proud of in your own making? What would you like to make in the future?** Reflect on both the making of your hypertext and your visual novel, and consider how your skills in programming, design, and writing may have developed over the course of the class. 

As with the critiques, any citation format, including footnotes, is fine. Submit the Word document or PDF to the Moodle by **Monday, March 17th at 5PM.** There are no extensions on the final reflection!
