## In Class Making Eight: Building a Ren'Py RPG

Over the course of Tuesday and Thursday's class, we will work through the structure of a simple [RPG](renpy_rpg) incorporating new custom screens, multiple potential characters, side character images, turn-based combat, and conditional-driven dialogue and outcomes.

This time, we will be working across multiple script files: refer to [intro.rpy](intro.rpy) and [journey.rpy](journey.rpy) for the code concepts covered during our follow-along demos. In class, start to reimagine the mechanics towards the goals of your own game project.

The RPG exercise will be graded in-class, as these mechanics should be incorporated into your project: there is no need to upload your own version.
