## Getting Started with Ren'Py

In class, we will be modifying the Ren'Py starter game, [The Question](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/thequestion.html#thequestion). Make sure you have Ren'Py installed before class, or use one of the lab computers to follow along. 

Working from this starting code, change:

- **The character name and color.** Replace Sylvie with your own character in the game's label. Change the color that represents the character to another color using a [hexadecimal color code](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/).
- **The backgrounds.** Following the tutorial in class, replace the default backgrounds with other settings. These can be drawn from photos, public domain or creative commons images, or generated images as you prefer.
- **The dialogue.** Start rewriting the scene for a different context while preserving the basic choice structure. As you edit, be attentive to the syntax and line breaks.
- **The choices.** Rewrite the simple choice sequence, replacing the options and allowing the player to reach a potentially different ending from the original text.

For this stage, we will not be hosting our games: instead, make sure your progress is checked
