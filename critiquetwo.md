## Critique Two: Electronic Literature

Our second critique exercise focuses on electronic literature.  If you wish to critique a work that isn't on this list, please make sure it falls under one of the categories of electronic literature as defined in Scott Rettberg's book: if it meets those requirements, email me or drop by office hours for approval.

Select any work that has been included in the Electronic Literature Collections. I recommend choosing a work from either Volume 3 or 4 for ease of access. Test the work before you commit to make sure you are able to get it to run, and let me know if you have any questions about how to access or deploy a particular work. Note that some pieces (such as Flash works that haven't been emulated) might no longer be supported.

Consider using the keywords and filters to find a work of interest to you. You'll need to complete at least one traversal of the work (2-3 are recommended) and document the process, so I suggest using screenshots to track interesting moments as you go. This analysis should be a short (500 - 750 words) essay. Your critique should include:

- **Briefly, describe the work in terms of Rettberg's definitions of electronic literature.** Note any unusual characteristics (such as the integration of a stats system, visuals etc) and make any comparisons to the other works we've viewed so far you find helpful
- **Discuss the work's design and narrative choices.** Are their decision points you found particularly striking? A character perspective that surprised you? Emotional stakes to the narrative that provide unusual engagement? Be precise and pick the most interesting part of the work from your perspective.
- **Analyze 2-3 key moments in your traversals.** Provide context, screenshots, and quotes as helpful, but make sure not just to describe what's happening: critique it, and think about what makes it stand out to you. Does it remind you of moments in our exploration of hypertexts, or is there a different type of interactivity or narrative design at work?

As with our first critique, don't worry about academic formality in your voice: feel free to use "I." A brief works cited should be included for any course texts, reviews, or games referenced.
