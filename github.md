## Hosting Your Twine

As part of the requirements for submission, you will need ti oublish a playable version on GitHub Pages (or your own site if preferred).

    -   **Steps**:

        1.  **Create a GitHub Repository**: Open GitHub Desktop and
            click on \"File -> New Repository\". Fill in the necessary
            details like the repository name, description, and local
            path. Click \"Create Repository\".

        2.  **Open the Repository in Explorer**: Once the
            repository is created, click the option to open it and view the files.

        3.  **Copy the HTML build of the project**: Copy the .html file of your final build, as well as any images or other files that it relies upon, into the repository.

        5.  **Commit and Push Changes**: Go back to GitHub Desktop, and
            you should see the new files you created. Write a commit
            message like \"Added project\". Then click \"Push origin\" to upload
            your changes to GitHub.

        6.  **Initialize GitHub Pages**: Go to your repository on
            GitHub.com. Click on the \"Settings\" tab, scroll down to
            the \"GitHub Pages\" section, and select the branch you want
            to use (usually main or master). Then select the root folder
            for the source. Save the settings, and GitHub will provide a
            link to view your site live.
