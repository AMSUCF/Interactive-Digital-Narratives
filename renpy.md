## Ren'Py Game

For this project, you'll be making a short visually-driven game. We will be iterating through the process in-class using the script for [The Question](https://renpy.org/doc/html/thequestion.html#thequestion) as a starting point and building a more complex, complete narrative with original characters and a range of choices.

Your game should be a short story, or introduction to a larger story, and will include:

- **Expressive character design.** Your art should be original (either modified from photos, or your own design, including AI art-alternative options discussed in class) and include at least three different characters for the central interactions. Consider the range of characters we've "met" this semester, and how you might give us a sense of meaning to the representation and range. (5 points)
- **Meaningful Dialogue.** Use Ren'Py's dialogue system to give the player a sense of opening context, progression through play, and a clear sense of conclusion. The amount of text will vary depending on your narrative concept, but interactive choices should be available throughout with at least three key points of decision and multiple endings. Remember that long blocks of texts are ineffective here: think about pacing, revealing text through interaction, and minimalism and apply the principles from *Game Design Vocabulary*. (5 points)
- **Environmental Design.** Your narrative should move through at least three original backgrounds (from your own photos or design), creating a unified aesthetic. Consider the minimalist and stylized works we've viewed as potential inspiration. (5 points)

Submit the link to your final hosted game. We will play games together in-class, so games must be submitted before our class meeting on March 11th!
