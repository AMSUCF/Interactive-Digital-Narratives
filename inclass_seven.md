## Building a Ren'Py Murder Mystery

Over the course of Tuesday and Thursday's class, we will work through the structure of a simple [murder mystery](renpy_murder_mystery.md) incorporating new images, audio, variables, interface elements, and endings. 

Reference the [complete sample script](script.rpy) as you work, and use generated or creative commons imagery and audio to build and test your game. Your version should include at least one modification to the inventory and one new ending.

Upload your version of the murder mystery to your GitHub Pages repository by building the web version of your game, copying the build folder to your repository, and pushing the changes through GitHub desktop. Submit the working URL of your build to the Moodle.
